# random-phrase-generator
Creates a randomly-generated short phrase of adjective(s) and noun(s)

Currently, it will only create an _Adjective_ _Noun_ phrase, but I plan to expand on this to give the user control of the phase's formatting.

--------------
Run the generator by navigating to its directory on your machine using a terminal and by entering the command:
  - **node rand-phrase-gen.js**
