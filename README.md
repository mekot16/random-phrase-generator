# random-phrase-generator
Creates a randomly-generated short phrase of adjective(s) and noun(s)

You can customize the phrase generated by passing 'n' for noun and 'a' for adjective as additional command line arguments. Additional arguments should be space-separated. The generator will accept up to 10 arguments. If an incorrect argument is entered or if no arguments are passed, the generator will return in its default _Adjective Noun_ format.

--------------
Run the generator by navigating to its directory on your machine using a terminal and by entering the command:
  - **node rand-phrase-gen.js**
  ~ or (custom mask)
  - **node rand-phrase-gen.js a n a a n**
